    <span class="lb">I analyzed Copenhagen neighborhoods to find the <b>best locations</b> for a stay in the city. This analysis is the final <b>Applied Capstone Project</b> of my IBM Data Science Certificate. Check out the certificate right here: <a href="https://coursera.org/verify/WWDHUGGCXLDG" target="_blank">IBM Certificate</a>
    </span>

    <span class="lb">The analysis was performed with the <b>help</b> of:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>List of all Copenhagen neighborhoods from <a href="https://www.regionh.dk/english/about-the-capital-region/facts-about-the-region/Pages/Postal-codes.aspx" target="_blank">Regionh.dk</a></li>
        <li>Geolocation data from <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start" target="_blank">Google Maps Geocoding API</a></li>
        <li>Venues data from <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare API</a></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="lb"><b>Observations and Conclusion:</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>Two relevant clusters emerge from the analysis as potential locations for a stay at Copenhagen.</li>
        <li>The <b>green Cluster</b> represented the remote area of the city with convenient-based activity, while the <b>red Cluster</b> concerned the center with a more diversified activity.</li>
        <li>The back/southewest of the city presented more essentials facilities. In the other hand, the center/east appeared to be more appropriate for a longer stay in Copenhagen.</li>
    </ul>
