    <span class="lb"><b>Website</b> created with my classmate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoann-peltier/" target="_blank">Yoann Peltier</a> to help fellow students be graduated.
        This site is intended for all students preparing the <b>DCG</b> exam.
    </span>

    <span class="lb">It puts at disposal the annals and answers of this exam according to a specific <b>process</b>:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Through our study of each DCG subject, we have noticed that the expectations remain more or less the same throughout the years on a given subject.
        We therefore have targeted for each subject, the main themes and their appearance through the annals since 2008.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Students can then see what is expected on the exam for each chapter of each subject.
            This allows them to easily find the annals and files that correspond to the topic they want to work on.</li>
