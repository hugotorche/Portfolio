    <span>I have been selected to go on exchange to Copenhagen Business School next semester. What better way to accompany this experience than with a <b>sporting challenge</b>! </span>
    <span>For the year 2021 I had set myself the goal of running a half-marathon in 2021. Initially, I wanted to achieve this goal in summer but when I saw that the Copenhagen Half Marathon was organized on <b>September 19th</b>, I jumped on the opportunity.</span>
    <span>The <b>goals</b> of the project are:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Sporting:</b> Finish the race and reach a time of less than 2 hours</li>
        <li><b>International:</b> Discover the Nordic culture and meet international people</li>
        <li><b>Environmental & Social:</b> Participate in a solidarity event</li>
        <li><b>Communication:</b> Promote the school's image by informing the stakeholders</li>
        <li><b>Personal:</b> Commitment, Autonomy and Agility</li></span>
