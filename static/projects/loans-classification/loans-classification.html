    <span class="lb">I used various algorithms to find the <b>best classification method</b> to predict wether a past loan was PAIDOFF or IN COLLECTION. This analysis is the final <b> Capstone Project</b> of the <b>Machine Learning</b> course from my IBM Data Science Certificate.

    <span class="lb">The analysis was performed with the <b>help</b> of:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Loans dataset provided by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en?lnk=m" target="_blank">IBM</a>.</li>
        <li>Data <b>pre-processing</b> pre-established: dealing with dates data, converting categorical features to numerical values, one hot encoding to set binary variables, normalizing data.</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn <b>metrics</b> available: jaccard score, f1 score, log loss.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="lb"><b>Results:</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li>First, I found that <b>KNN</b> was the most accurate method to classify loans of the <b>initial dataset</b>: a K value of 7 provided an accuracy rate of 79% on the test set.</li>
        <li>Then as you can see in the report, <b>SVM</b> appeared to be the most accurate method to classify loans of the <b>new test set (unknown data)</b> with an accuracy rate of 78%%.</li>
    </ul>
