<div>
    <span>I created a <b>TikTok channel</b> to display my juggling practices and to improve my skills.</span>

    <span class="lb">The idea was really to bring <b>more fun and motivation to my juggling</b>. Then to feel responsible towards the community in terms of performance and rigor.</span>

    <span class="lb">In few months, I reached more than <b>20K followers</b> and more than <b>400K likes</b>. I really want to keep going as it benefits my practice and viewers seem to enjoy my videos.</span>

    <span class="lb"><b>Update:</b> I renamed the channel Hugo Torch√© for more consistency between my social networks</span>
