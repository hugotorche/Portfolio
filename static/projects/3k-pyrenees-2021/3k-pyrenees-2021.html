    <span>During summer 2021, I spent two weeks doing hiking in French 'Pyrénées'. My objectives were to do my <b>first 3000m peak</b>, to improve my <b>hiking skills</b>, and to see some <b>wonderful landscapes!</b></span>
    <span>You will find all my <b>excursions</b> below:</span>

        <br>
        <span class="subtitle">1 - La Grande Fâche - 3005m</span class="subtitle">
        <br>
        <span class="lb">Accessible but demanding summit, which requires a particular attention in its approach, as testified by the length of its ridge. The weather conditions didn't allow us to have a glimpse of this mythical peak of the French Pyrenees. We hope to discover this Grande Fâche in the future. </span class="lb">
        <br>

        <span class="subtitle">2 - Le Grand Tapou et le Pic du Milieu - 3150m</span class="subtitle">
        <br>
        <span class="lb">A solitary summit that has surrounded itself with two brave rock companions for lack of attracting humans. What a pleasure it was to meet the three rocks that make up this proud and imposing procession. In the absence of technicality, this meeting will require an interest and an endurance without fault.</span class="lb">
        <br>

        <span class="subtitle">3 - Le lac et plateau d'Anayet - 2230m</span class="subtitle">
        <br>
        <span class="lb">The lake of Anayet opens to the world like an easy and soft shell. It serves you Jean-Pierre on a plate with space and refreshment. Expect to discover an easy life, a hand that nature holds out to you in this valley with the smell of winter sports and pastures.</span class="lb">
        <br>

        <span class="subtitle">4 - Le Vignemale - 3298m</span class="subtitle">
        <br>
        <span class="lb">The Vignemale transcends the spirit beyond the path, the landscapes and its nature. It is by its spirituality that it will be necessary to approach it and to admire it throughout the expedition.  From its glacier to its Isards and its caves, a summit that will leave an indelible mark on you, just like the heritage it has given to the Pyrenees. This experience will be earned by crampons and climbing.</span class="lb">
        <br>

        <span class="subtitle">5 - Le Pic de Ger - 2613m</span class="subtitle">
        <br>
        <span class="lb">The masked and rustic summit will take you by surprise. At first sight, this peak is nice, but then it puts us to the test with its dryness and its stones piled up by thousands which make the climb more painful. Resilience will then be necessary to break through this iron wall and discover the richness of the panorama that this summit can offer us.</span class="lb">
        <br>

        <span class="subtitle">6 - Le Lac d'Isabe - 1925m</span class="subtitle">
        <br>
        <span class="lb">Grandiose and wild, these are the two qualifiers that could be attributed to this lake of the Ossau valley. Wild by its thick forest, its flowery fields, its history which often saw the bears taking residence around its places. Grandiose by its demanding ascent, the beauty of its lake and the scale of its cirque.</span class="lb">
