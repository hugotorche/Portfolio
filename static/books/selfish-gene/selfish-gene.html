        <ul>
            <li>Replicators are the origin of all living things, the only entity that allows life to exist. They are now called "genes" (DNA), and you are their survival machine.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Of all the animals, man is the only one who can use culture and influences to dominate his selfish genes. We must teach our children altruism because it is not natural.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Two things will survive you after you die: your genes and your memes (human culture). Genes are immortal but it is through cultural input that you will achieve posterity as an individual.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Every living organism will act to achieve the same goal: the survival and propagation of its genes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Nature is selfish, and you cannot expect it to help you generously. Both selfishness and altruism can be explained by the law of selfishness of genes.</li>
