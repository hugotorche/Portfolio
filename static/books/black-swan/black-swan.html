        <ul>
            <li>The Black Swan manifests itself as a surprising, aberrant and unpredictable event. It is necessary to go beyond the simple reading of events to have a better understanding of its dynamics.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The Black Swan thrives in an open environment subject to the chance of serendipity: looking for one thing and finding another. To expose yourself to positive Black Swans, prefer scalable domains (without a direct correlation between work time and profit: intellectual production).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Apply empirical skepticism to your reading of the world to avoid the trap of Platonicism (focus on form) and deal with chance.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The Black Swan exists only in Extremistan (scalable universe: type 2 chance) and not in Mediocristan.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Being informed does not mean understanding the course of things. Moreover, the past is not necessarily useful to understand the future. Rely on knowledge but don't be a turkey.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Avoid epistemic arrogance: falsely believing that you know (opposite of empirical skepticism). In some ways, information can be detrimental to knowledge. Prefer books to newspapers.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is better to admit that you don't know than to fall into the confirmation error (focusing only on what you see). Similarly, avoid the fallacy of playfulness (calculation) and the fallacy of narrative (consistency).</li>
