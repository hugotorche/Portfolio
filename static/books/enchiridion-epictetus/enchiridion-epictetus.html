            <li>To live as a philosopher and attain wisdom is to constantly practice virtue. This way of life consists of 3 parts: logic, physics and ethics. Philosophy is theoretical and is lived through practice.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The purpose of life is to live in conformity with nature, It is in nature that man must find his reason, his standards and his functioning.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Man has no power over the events of the world and the vagaries of life, which have been decided in advance by divine providence. He should not try to control external events but only play his role.</li>
            <br>
            <li>On the other hand, life is not synonymous with submission to destiny, since man is master of his freedom and his happiness. Man is therefore free provided that he focuses on the things in his power, his ability to choose.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is then necessary to change your look on the world to know what depends on you, that is to say the control of your assent, your desires and your impulse. The relationship with these representations of the external world is the key to freedom.</li>
            <br>
            <li>There is no natural evil because the unhappiness comes from a bad control of the representations, from a bad choice of the man.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Man's relationship with others must be guided by nature and therefore by reason. To act with equity and justice thanks to detachment from the outside world.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To look at everything you possess as loans, to be ready to lose everything when the time comes.</li>
