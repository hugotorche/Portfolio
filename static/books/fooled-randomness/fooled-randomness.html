    <span><b>Key points:</b></span>
        <ul>
            <li>Each individual believes that he is the most intelligent and can predict the future. This pushes the human being to errors of reasoning by basing himself only on his intuitions. But reality is often much more complex.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Human beings are subject to their emotions and are incapable of making objective abstractions. Beware of yourself when making decisions.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beware of the Darwinist illusion of survivor bias: only the best survive. Successes are much more often explained by luck and by being in the right place at the right time.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To estimate the value of an outcome, think of alternative stories. Balanced thinking must weigh the risks and consider the fatal possibilities.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Accept the fact that unlikely and unpredictable events will eventually occur. Thinking based on past experience or stable cycles is useless for dealing with Black Swans.</li>
            <br>
            <li>While it is not possible to control or predict events, you can control your emotions and reactions to them. Act by ignoring success and focusing on yourself (ancient Stoic thought).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Learn to see unpredictability as an ally by finding indirect ways to tame it: no set schedules, less exposure to media, investing long term without looking at fluctuations, moving to a place where you are a model of success.</li>
