        <ul>
            <li>All men are beings of reason and are equal before knowledge. The problem is the way they use this reason: the method.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The first step in reaching the truth is to put aside one's opinions and knowledge to reform one's mind. Independence of mind is the key: one must draw knowledge from oneself.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To reform your mind, you need a method: doubt (retain only the obvious), divide the difficulty (simplify a problem), lead by order (from the simplest to the most difficult), check that you have not forgotten anything.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To be able to think serenely, you need a provisional morality: prefer conformism/moderation, be firm in your opinions/actions, limit your will to your field of action, cultivate your reason.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The first certainties are: the cogito (I think therefore I am), the soul (thought) and God (perfect being).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Matter and the human body are purely mechanical. Only the soul distinguishes humans from animals (soul/matter dualism).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Technology is at the service of man, but man must not take himself for God and must respect the laws of nature.</li>
