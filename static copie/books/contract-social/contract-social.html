        <ul>
            <li>Freedom is transformed when man enters society: from a natural freedom (linked to abilities), to a civil and political freedom (linked to association and the search for the common good).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mutual association towards the common good poses a social contract that brings together equality and freedom (each man sees his freedom transformed), and brings about the emergence of a sovereign people.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Popular sovereignty is expressed by the general will: inalienable, indivisible, limited. This will is itself expressed by the law, which must ensure the equality of all and the freedom of each person: same rights and same duties.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The establishment of a legislator allows citizens to create laws. A government ("prince") serves the general will of the sovereign people and the common good. There must be a balance between the powers of the government and the sovereign people.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The cohesion of the people can be strengthened by civil religion.</li>
