    <span><b>Key points:</b></span>
        <ul>
            <li>The objective of blogs is to attract the eye to make profit and/or be bought out. Apprehending this fact allows us to better understand how they work.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Blogs are based on the principle of the snowball effect, the articles they publish must have a potential of virality. This snowball effect can help charitable causes but also develop hatred and violence.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Understanding the blogosphere allows one to scam the media in turn. It is easy to manipulate bloggers with money or free products.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The main flaw of bloggers is the unreliability of their sources due to the reign of speed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>We can take advantage of the flaws in the system to get the attention of publishers. Extreme emotions and statistical analysis are the most profitable flaws.</li>
            <br>
            <li>There are foolproof techniques to get an article published: use a humorous pen, create a fake exclusive information, exaggerate the words, etc.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Blogs have totally redefined the notion of truth with the internet: legitimacy has been replaced by virality. The more information is repeated, the more authentic it is: but the problem of distortion.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The techniques used on the Internet are very profitable for websites, but can be fatal for its victims: psychological dangers, barriers to raw information, etc.</li>
