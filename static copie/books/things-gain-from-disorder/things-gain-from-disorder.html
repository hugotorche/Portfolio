        <ul>
            <li>History has been built on the occurrence of black swans, which are rare and unforeseen events, and whose consequences, positive or negative, are unimaginable.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Trying to predict black swans is a waste of time and energy. On the contrary, one must work to improve one's resilience to these events.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Developments therefore occur in fits and starts and not in a predictable way. Thus, people often prefer not to worry about them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To cope with black swans, the status quo is not enough. On the contrary, it is necessary to set up anti-fragile systems that allow adaptation to unpredictability.</li>
            <br>
            <li>A fragile system is concave because the occurrence of a black swan generates more losses than benefits, compared to its initial functioning. Conversely, an anti-fragile system is convex because the occurrence of a black swan generates more profits than losses, compared to its initial functioning.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To be convex and become antifragile, you must think long-term and endure mistakes and losses in the hope of future success. Keep as many options open as possible, constantly trying and testing.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Risk pooling must be reduced, as it reinforces inequality, serves only the same people, and prevents the development of antifragile systems. The burden of failure must be borne by those who caused it.</li>
